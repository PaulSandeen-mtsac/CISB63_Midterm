# Mt. SAC CISB63 Midterm - 'Medi': The NLP-Based Medical Diagnostic Chatbot

Providing timely and accurate medical advice for non-life-threatening conditions is one aspect of the health care system where technology can be a benefit, especially to historically underserved communities.

A chatbot is an automated agent (artificial intelligence) that can interact with a user to ask questions and receive answers from a knowledge base developed by experts. Chatbots use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user input to attempt to understand the words and context of the conversation. Medi is an interactive medical diagnostic chatbot.

The user will tell Medi about the nature of their health issue, and Medi will ask a question about when the issue started and another question related to the issue, and then issue a recommendation. Medi will then ask for feedback about the nature of the recommendation.

The project is divided into two parts: The first part is the NLP-powered  ‘engine’ that runs the Medi chatbot; the second part uses NLP techniques to analyze the information provided by the user during the chat session to evaluate Medi’s performance.
